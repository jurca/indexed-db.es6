/**
 * The {@linkcode PromiseSync} is a synchronous alternative to the Promise/A+
 * API, meaning that all callbacks are executed synchronously.
 * 
 * The synchronous promise is used for in-transaction operations to ensure the
 * following:
 * - It allows safe wrapping of IndexedDB request objects, allowing the
 *   callbacks to request more operations on the transaction without the risk
 *   of the transaction becoming inactive. Promise/A+ callbacks are executed
 *   asynchronously, so the transaction will be marked as inactive before the
 *   {@code then} callback of an Promise/A+-wrapped request would be executed.
 * - Firefox (37, and probably later versions too) does not allow the
 *   Promise/A+ callbacks to request new operations on the transaction even if
 *   the transaction is still alive (it throws an error claiming the
 *   transaction is inactive).
 * 
 * Since safe wrapping of IndexedDB requests is the main use of the
 * {@linkcode PromiseSync} promises, the {@linkcode PromiseSync.resolve()}
 * method can handle {@linkcode IDBRequest} instances as an argument.
